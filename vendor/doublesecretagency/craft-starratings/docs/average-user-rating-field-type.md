# "Average User Rating" field type

You can use the "Average User Rating" field type to see an average rating from the Control Panel.

This is a **read only** field... it's for seeing the current average rating of an element. You may choose to use this field type if you have [users rating elements](/display-star-ratings/) on the front-end.

This field type really shines when viewing them as columns on the entries index.

If your stars use an optional `key`, you can specify that key in your field settings...
