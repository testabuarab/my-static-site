**Keep track of how many times an element has been viewed.** Tracking is simple and extremely flexible!

 - Three ways to [log views](/how-to-increment-the-counter/) (via Twig, PHP, or AJAX)
 - Allows [multiple counters](/using-a-unique-key/) on the same element
 - Easily [sort](/sort-by-most-viewed/) by "most viewed"
 - Display view totals [in the control panel](/total-views-fieldtype/)

Works for all element types, including Entries, Assets, Users, Categories... even Commerce Products and 3rd party elements!

<div style="padding:40px 0 40px; text-align:center;">
    <img :src="$withBase('/images/fieldtype-totalviews-index.png')" class="dropshadow" alt="">
</div>
