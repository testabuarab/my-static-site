**Note**: _The license fee for this plugin is $59.00 via the Craft Plugin Store._

### Upgrading from Retour 1.x for Craft CMS 2.x

Even though this version of Retour was entirely rewritten for Craft CMS 3, it was designed to use all of the same data used by the Craft CMS 2.x version of Retour.

So any existing redirects and statistics will continue to be in place.

## Used By
